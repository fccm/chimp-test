# Chimpanzee Memory Test

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A

Ayumu the chimpanzee has made headlines around the world for his ability to beat
humans on memory tests, in both speed and accuracy. Does Ayumu's ability force
us to reconsider our assumptions about human superiority to other primates?


# Execution

You need ocamlsdl2 to run and/or compile:  
https://github.com/fccm/OCamlSDL2

This version of the program is known to work with:
- SDL2 version 2.0.10
- OCaml version 4.14.0
- OCamlSDL2 version 0.03

After installing ocamlsdl2 you can run the program with:
```
ocaml -w -6 -I $(ocamlfind query sdl2) sdl2.cma chimp_test.ml
```

If you just compiled ocamlsdl2 without installing it:
```
ocaml -w -6 -I ../OCamlSDL2/src sdl2.cma chimp_test.ml
```

# Result of the Test

I personally spent 20 minutes by day for 3 days before to be able to pass
this test.
At the beginning I was only trying to memorise 3 positions to get used to
the exercise, after I exercised 5, then 7 and so on.

The mental method that I use to memorise the 9 positions is that I mentally
draw a path from number 1 to 9, and this is this drawing that I memorise rather
than really the 9 positions.

I'm a person that learned to draw young, and if you watch tutorials about how to draw
on a video website you will see that it's usually recommanded to draw construction
lines and shapes before to draw your subject. When you learn how to draw you really
draw these construction lines and shapes, but after a while you will just draw it
in your head. So maybe this is why I feel comfortable to mentally draw the path
of this test from 1 to 9.

I don't beat Ayumu in speed, but I only trained 3 times for 20 minutes, Ayumu
spent more time than that to train, and there's no rewards that comes out from the
side of my screen when I succeed.

If there was free money coming out from ATM's with this test I bet a lot of
people would be as good as Ayumu on it.
